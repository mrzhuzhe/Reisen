GPT text

This code defines a function called mpm_update() that advances the simulation by one timestep using the Material Point Method (MPM). It also defines several helper functions, such as trilinear_weight(), trilinear_gradient(), and trilinear_laplacian(), which are used by the MPM algorithm.
"""

"""
To use the mpm_update() function in a simulation, you would first need to initialize the grid and particle data using the mpm_init() function. You would then need to call the mpm_update() function at each timestep to advance the simulation.

Here is an example of how you might use these functions in a simulation:
"""

# Initialize the grid and particles
mpm_init()

# Run the simulation for 100 timesteps
for i in range(100):
    # Update the simulation
    mpm_update()

    # Visualize the results
    grid_v.to_numpy()
    particles_x.to_numpy()

"""
This code initializes the grid and particle data using the mpm_init() function, and then runs the simulation for 100 timesteps by calling the mpm_update() function at each timestep. It also visualizes the results of the simulation by converting the grid and particle data to NumPy arrays.

Note that this is just an example of how you might use these functions in a simulation. In a real-world application, you would need to add additional code to handle boundary conditions, handle collisions, and so on.
